### Compose Multiplatform .cursorrules

### Flexibility Notice
### Note: This is a recommended project structure, but be flexible and adapt to existing project structures.
### Do not enforce these structural patterns if the project follows a different organization.
### Focus on maintaining consistency with the existing project architecture while applying Compose Multiplatform best practices.

### Project Architecture and Best Practices
const composeMultiplatformBestPractices = [
    "Adapt to existing project architecture while maintaining clean code principles",
    "Maximize code sharing between platforms while respecting platform-specific requirements",
    "Follow Material Design 3 guidelines with platform-appropriate adaptations",
    "Implement clean architecture with shared domain/data layers and platform-specific presentation when needed",
    "Use Kotlin coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations across platforms",
    "Implement dependency injection using Koin for multiplatform projects",
    "Follow unidirectional data flow with shared ViewModels and platform-specific UI adaptations",
    "Use Compose Multiplatform navigation(navigation-compose:2.9.0-beta01) with platform-aware routing",
    "Implement proper state hoisting and composition with shared state management",
    "Handle platform-specific resources and assets appropriately",
    "Use expect/actual declarations for platform-specific implementations",
    "Implement proper lifecycle management across different platforms"
];
